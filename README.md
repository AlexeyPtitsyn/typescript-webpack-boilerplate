# Typescript-webpack-boilerplate

This is a very basic boilerplate for Typescript with webpack (without React or other frameworks).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
3. Now you can use npm commands:

Compile and watch mode:
```bash
npm start
```

Build mode:
```bash
npm build
```
